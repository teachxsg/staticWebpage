                        <p class="text-white">Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and versatile in application. Our Python lesson for beginners covers the basic syntax and structure of the language, including print statements, variables, data types, arithmetic operations, and input statements. We also offer a Capstone Project in the form of a Birth Year Calculator, as well as a Graduation Quiz to test your knowledge and progress.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Print statements are one of the most fundamental concepts in Python. They are used to display information on the screen and can be as simple as printing a single word or as complex as printing the results of a function. The syntax for print statements is straightforward, using the keyword 'print' followed by the information to be displayed within parentheses.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Variables are used to store data in Python, making it easier to manipulate and access later in the code. They can be assigned any value and given any name, but it is best practice to use descriptive names to make the code more readable. For example, 'age' would be a better variable name than 'a'.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Data types are essential in Python as they determine how the code will interpret and manipulate the data. The three most commonly used data types are int (integer), str (string), and float (floating-point number). Integers are whole numbers, strings are a sequence of characters, and floating-point numbers include decimal points.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Converting between data types is important in Python, as it allows us to manipulate data in different ways. For example, we can convert a string to an integer or a float to an integer. This can be done using built-in Python functions such as int(), str(), and float(). </p>
                        <p class="text-white"> operations are used in Python to perform mathematical calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are performed using the appropriate symbols, such as '+' for addition and '-' for subtraction.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Input statements are used to allow users to input data into a program. This data can then be manipulated and processed by the program. The syntax for an input statement is similar to a print statement, using the keyword 'input' followed by a prompt within parentheses.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Our Capstone Project, the Birth Year Calculator, is designed to help students apply their knowledge of Python to a real-world problem. The project involves creating a program that can calculate a person's birth year based on their age and the current year.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Finally, our Graduation Quiz is designed to test students' knowledge and progress throughout the course. It covers all the essential topics, including print statements, variables, data types, arithmetic operations, input statements, and the Birth Year Calculator.</p>

                        <p class="text-white">In our Python lessons for basics, we cover some of the fundamental concepts and features of the language. </p>
                        <p class="text-white">Operators are an essential component of any programming language, and Python has a variety of them. In our lessons, we cover comparison operators, which are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (True or False). Examples of comparison operators in Python include "==" (equals), "!=" (not equals), ">" (greater than), "<" (less than), ">=" (greater than or equal to), and "<=" (less than or equal to).</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Another type of operator we cover in our lessons is the logic operator. Logic operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean value. The most common logic operators in Python are "and," "or," and "not."</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Control structures are another important concept in programming, and Python offers several of them. In our lessons, we cover the "if-else" control structure, which allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False. We also cover the "while" control structure, which allows you to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is True.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">To put these concepts into practice, we have a capstone project in our Python lessons for basics. The capstone project is an arithmetic calculator that allows you to perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project helps you apply what you've learned about operators and control structures in Python.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Finally, we wrap up our Python lessons for basics with a graduation quiz. The quiz tests your understanding of the concepts and features covered in the lessons, and it's a great way to reinforce what you've learned.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">our Python lessons for basics cover operators, control structures, and a capstone project that puts these concepts into practice. The graduation quiz is a great way to test your understanding of the material and prepare you for more advanced Python concepts.                        </p>
